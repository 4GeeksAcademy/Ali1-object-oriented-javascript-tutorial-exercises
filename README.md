During these exercises, we will explore object-oriented programming concepts and how to apply them using Javascript. Sadly, the javascript object implementations do not have concepts like Method Overriding, Polymorphism, Private properties, etc. But I will make a reasonable effort to use all the available object-oriented features:

1. Create new instances.
2. Create a class.
3. Define your first property.
4. The constructor and constructor parameters.
5. Some practical class examples.

This tutorial its part of a bigger group of tutorials about web development, this repository focuses only in Object Oriented Programming.

You can [start the tutorial online](#one-click-installation) in just 10 seconds or [download the source files](#local-installation) to do it locally.

I strongly recommend doing this tutorials in this order:

1. [Introduction to HTML](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-tutorial-exercises-course)
2. [Introduction to CSS](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course)
3. [Introduction to Javascript](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial)
4. [Introduction to The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-dom-tutorial-exercises)
5. [Using events & The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-events-tutorial-exercises)
6. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/object-oriented-javascript-tutorial-exercises) ‚Üê you are here now üî•

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by cliking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/object-oriented-javascript-tutorial-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/object-oriented-javascript-tutorial-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, if exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below

1) Make sure you have [learnpack](https://github.com/learnpack/learnpack-cli) installed and `node.js` version 14+. This is the command to install learnpack.  

```sh
$ npm i learnpack -g
```

2) Clone or download this repository. Once you finish downloading, you will find a new folder with a subdirectory "exercises" that contains all the exercises within.

3) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
$ learnpack start
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.js:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
1. **index.html:** represents the entry website.
1. **style.css:** your website styles, they have to be imported from the index.html
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: These exercises have automatic grading but it is somewhat rigid, I recommend you ignore the tests, consider them as a recommendation or you could get frustrated.
